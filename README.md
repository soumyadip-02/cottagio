# Cottagio â€” Static Marketplace

A small static marketplace scaffold (React + Vite + Tailwind) with light/dark mode, product pages, seller contact, cart, About and Contact pages.

Quick start

This repository now contains a plain static site using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript (no frameworks).

How to preview

- Option 1 (open locally): open `index.html` in your browser (best to use a local static server due to CORS/browser restrictions on modules).
- Option 2 (quick local server with Python):

```powershell
# from repository root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/index.html
```

Notes

- Seller contact numbers are shown on product pages (this demo has no backend or real messaging).
- Cart is stored in localStorage and persists between reloads.
- Theme is toggled with the Theme button and persisted to localStorage.
